You may download the backtest framework here and run it in local environment with data available. When you have finished your work at local environment, please update your new work here.
Here we have already finished 4 factors based on Reversal Effect and 5 factors about Price-Volumn relationship and volatility.
For Multi-Factor Model Implementation we have implemented two method to get the combined factor, equal-weighted and Linear-Regression in sklearn.
